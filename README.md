I recommend watching this video to understand how CRUD operations are handled in the backend. It shows how to use Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL to implement CRUD functionality.

But the video does not cover Sequelize, which we are using in our project. However, the concepts presented in the video should still be applicable and useful.

You can find the code for Create, Read, and Delete operations covered in the video in this repository. I've not finished implementing the update operation discussed towards the end of the video (around 59:18). Feel free to use this code as a reference.
